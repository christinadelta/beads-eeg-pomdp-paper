All avalyses were conducted using Matlab 2021a. For behavioural analyses and modelling we used custom scripts and functions. For EEG preprocessing and analysis we used the SPM toolbox:

### General information about data, and code 
* For preprocessing of the EEG data we used SPM12 with custom scrips and functions that can be found in code/EEG/spm_analysis/ directory.
* For the Mass Univariate Analyses and for the Individual Differences Analyses we used the SPM EEG user interface.
* All EEG figures were generated using the SPM EEG user interface and manually extracted for visualisation. 
* All code related to behavioural analysis, model fitting, parameter recovery and model recovery can be found in code/behav directory
